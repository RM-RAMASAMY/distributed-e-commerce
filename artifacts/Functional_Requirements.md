# Distributed E-Commerce System: Component Responsibilities

This document outlines the responsibilities of each component in the distributed e-commerce system based on the reference flow diagram.

---

## **System Flow Overview**

1. **User Requests Product List**:
   - The **API Gateway** receives the request and checks if the product data is cached in **Redis**.
   - If the data is not cached, the **Product Service** queries the **Products Database** to fetch the product list.
   - The fetched product data is stored in **Redis** for future requests.
   - The **API Gateway** returns the product list to the user.

2. **User Places an Order**:
   - The **API Gateway** forwards the order request to the **Order Service**.
   - The **Order Service** validates the order by checking product availability through the **Product Service**.
   - If stock is sufficient, the **Order Service** publishes an `OrderCreated` event to the **Kafka Message Broker**.

3. **Stock Deduction and Payment Processing**:
   - The **Inventory Service** consumes the `OrderCreated` event and deducts stock in the **Products Database**.
   - The **Inventory Service** publishes a `StockUpdated` event to notify other services.
   - The **Payment Service** consumes the `OrderCreated` event and processes the payment through an external payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal).
   - Based on the payment outcome, the **Payment Service** publishes either a `PaymentSuccess` or `PaymentFailed` event.

4. **Order Status Update**:
   - If the payment is successful:
     - The **Order Service** updates the order status in the **Orders Database**.
     - The status is cached in **Redis** for quick retrieval.
   - If the payment fails:
     - The **Inventory Service** restores the deducted stock.
     - The **Order Service** notifies the user to try again.

5. **System Monitoring and Tracing**:
   - **Prometheus** collects metrics such as API latency, service response times, and Kafka message processing times.
   - Metrics are visualized in **Grafana** dashboards for real-time monitoring.
   - **Jaeger** traces requests across all services to identify bottlenecks and ensure smooth operation.

## **Component Responsibilities**

### **API Gateway**
- Route requests to the appropriate services (e.g., Product Service, Order Service).
- Check and retrieve cached product data from **Redis**.
- Forward order requests to the **Order Service**.
- Report API latency metrics to **Prometheus**.

### **User Service**
- Validate user credentials and provide user details for order processing.
- Fetch user-specific data (e.g., address, preferences) required for order placement.

### **Product Service**
- Query **Redis** for cached product data.
- Fetch product data from the **Products Database** if not cached.
- Cache product data in **Redis** for future requests.
- Verify stock availability for order validation.

### **Order Service**
- Validate order details and check product availability.
- Publish `OrderCreated` events to the **Kafka Message Broker**.
- Update order status in the **Orders Database** based on payment outcomes.
- Cache order status in **Redis** for quick retrieval.

### **Inventory Service**
- Verify stock availability for orders.
- Deduct stock when an order is placed.
- Publish `StockUpdated` events to **Kafka**.
- Restore stock if the payment fails.

### **Payment Service**
- Process payments through external gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
- Publish `PaymentSuccess` or `PaymentFailed` events to **Kafka**.
- Notify the **Order Service** about payment outcomes.

### **Redis Cache**
- Store frequently accessed data (e.g., product details, order statuses) for faster retrieval.
- Invalidate or update cache entries when the underlying data changes.

### **Kafka Message Broker**
- Distribute `OrderCreated`, `StockUpdated`, and payment outcome events to subscribed services.
- Ensure message durability and replayability for critical events.

### **PostgreSQL Databases**
- **Users Database**: Store user details (e.g., credentials, addresses, preferences).
- **Products Database**: Store product details (e.g., name, price, stock levels).
- **Orders Database**: Store order details (e.g., user ID, product IDs, order status).

### **Prometheus (Metrics)**
- Collect metrics such as API latency, service response times, and Kafka message processing times.
- Trigger alerts for anomalies (e.g., high latency, service downtime).

### **Grafana (Monitoring)**
- Visualize metrics in real-time dashboards for system health and performance.
- Display triggered alerts for quick action.

### **Jaeger (Tracing)**
- Trace requests across all services to identify bottlenecks and failures.
- Provide detailed breakdowns of request paths and latencies.

## **Next Steps**
- Implement the responsibilities for each component as outlined above.
- Ensure proper integration between components for seamless operation.
- Set up monitoring and tracing tools for observability.
