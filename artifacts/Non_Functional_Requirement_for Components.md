# System Architecture Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for various services and infrastructure components in our system. It covers performance, scalability, security, reliability, monitoring, and other critical aspects necessary for optimal operation.

---

- **Reliability:** Ensure 99.9% availability with failover mechanisms to reroute traffic in case of service failure.
- **Monitoring:** Should provide detailed logs and metrics for request counts, latencies, and error rates, integrated with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Must gracefully handle downstream service failures and provide meaningful error messages to users.

## User Service
- **Performance:** Must respond to user-related queries (e.g., fetching user profiles) within 100ms under normal load.
- **Scalability:** Should scale horizontally to handle increased user traffic during peak times.
- **Data Privacy:** Must comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA, ensuring user data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Consistency:** Ensure data consistency for user profiles across distributed systems, especially during updates.
- **Availability:** Must maintain 99.95% uptime to ensure uninterrupted user operations.
- **Auditability:** Should log all user-related operations (e.g., profile updates) for audit and debugging purposes.

---

## Product Service
- **Performance:** Cache hits should respond within 10ms, and cache misses (fetching from the database) should respond within 200ms.
- **Caching:** Must implement Redis caching for frequently accessed product data to reduce database load.
- **Scalability:** Should handle high concurrent product queries without performance degradation, especially during flash sales.
- **Availability:** Ensure 99.95% uptime with redundancy and failover mechanisms.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure product data consistency between the cache and the PostgreSQL database.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Must handle cache failures gracefully by falling back to the database without disrupting the user experience.

---

## Order Service
- **Performance:** Must process orders within 300ms end-to-end under normal load, including interactions with inventory and payment services.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Should use Kafka to publish and consume events (e.g., `OrderCreated`, `PaymentSuccess`, `PaymentFailed`) for asynchronous communication.
- **Idempotency:** Must ensure idempotent operations to handle retries without duplicating orders.
- **Scalability:** Should handle at least 5,000 concurrent orders during peak traffic.
- **Data Consistency:** Ensure eventual consistency across services (e.g., inventory and payment) using distributed transactions or compensating actions.
- **Auditability:** Log all order-related events for traceability and debugging.

---

## Inventory Service
- **Performance:** Must update stock levels within 200ms of receiving an event from Kafka.
- **Atomicity:** Ensure atomic operations to prevent stock inconsistencies during concurrent updates.
- **Scalability:** Should handle high throughput for stock updates, especially during flash sales or bulk order processing.
- **Monitoring:** Provide real-time stock monitoring for administrators via Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Must handle Kafka message delivery failures gracefully and retry updates without data loss.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure stock levels are accurate and consistent across the system.

---

## Payment Service
- **Performance:** Must process payments within 500ms for 95% of transactions, including interactions with external payment gateways.
- **Security:** Ensure PCI DSS compliance for secure payment processing, including encryption of sensitive data.
- **Reliability:** Must integrate with multiple payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and provide failover support in case one gateway is unavailable.
- **Scalability:** Should handle high transaction volumes during peak times without performance degradation.
- **Event Publishing:** Publish Kafka events (`PaymentSuccess`, `PaymentFailed`) to notify other services of payment outcomes.
- **Auditability:** Log all payment transactions with detailed information for reconciliation and debugging.

---

## Redis Cache
- **Performance:** Must handle 100,000 read/write operations per second with a latency of less than 5ms.
- **Scalability:** Should support horizontal scaling with clustering to handle increased load.
- **Data Eviction:** Implement data eviction policies (e.g., LRU) to manage memory efficiently.
- **High Availability:** Ensure replication for high availability and failover support.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Provide mechanisms for backup and restore to prevent data loss during failures.

---

## Kafka Message Broker
- **Performance:** Must support at least 50,000 messages per second with a latency of less than 10ms.
- **Durability:** Ensure message durability with replication across brokers to prevent data loss.
- **Delivery Semantics:** Support exactly-once delivery for critical events like payment and stock updates.
- **Scalability:** Should scale horizontally to handle increased message throughput.
- **Monitoring:** Provide metrics for message lag, broker health, and consumer offsets via Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Must handle broker failures gracefully with automatic leader election.

---

## PostgreSQL Databases (Users, Products, Orders)
- **Performance:** Must handle high write throughput during peak traffic (e.g., flash sales) with a response time of less than 50ms for queries.
- **ACID Compliance:** Ensure ACID compliance for transactional integrity.
- **Scalability:** Support vertical and horizontal scaling to handle growing data volumes.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Implement automatic backups and point-in-time recovery to prevent data loss.
- **High Availability:** Ensure replication for high availability and failover support.
- **Monitoring:** Provide metrics for query performance, connection counts, and replication lag.

---

## Prometheus (Metrics)
- **Data Collection:** Must collect metrics with a polling interval of 15 seconds or less.
- **Data Retention:** Store metrics data for at least 30 days for historical analysis.
- **High Availability:** Ensure Prometheus is deployed in a highly available setup to prevent data loss.
- **Alerting:** Provide real-time alerts for system anomalies (e.g., high latency, service downtime).
- **Scalability:** Should handle metrics from all services without performance degradation.

---

## Grafana (Monitoring)
- **Custom Dashboards:** Must support customizable dashboards for visualizing metrics from all system components.
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Provide real-time visualization of metrics with minimal lag.
- **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict dashboard access based on user roles.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with Prometheus and other data sources.

---

## Jaeger (Tracing)
- **Trace Coverage:** Must trace 100% of requests across all services during normal operation.
- **Latency Analysis:** Provide end-to-end latency breakdowns for each request to identify bottlenecks.
- **Data Retention:** Store trace data for at least 7 days for debugging purposes.
- **Scalability:** Should handle tracing for high traffic volumes without significant overhead.
- **Integration:** Integrate with Grafana for visualizing trace data alongside metrics.
